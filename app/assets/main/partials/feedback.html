    <h2>Feedback Welcome</h2>

    <p>Medalerts was built as a beta to showcase our ability to rapidly create a product of value and in response to the RFP from 18F. It was scoped to create a lightweight app that delivers useful functionality to the user. This prototype leverages the openFDA beta research project and not for clinical use. Please refer to the OpenFDA <a href="https://open.fda.gov/terms/">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

    <p>In future phases of development, the product roadmap may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The ability to register and receive email, social or SMS notifications about the medications they follow.</li>
        <li>Create and follow multiple lists.</li>
        <li>Integration with other service APIs for a richer experience.</li>
        <li>The ability to cross reference your list of followed drugs for adverse reactions to each other. </li>
        <li>Increase information, crowdsourced reviews, and listing alternative drugs within each medications detail view.</li>
    </ul>
